      "aboutme2": `
      Early in my career, I focused on optimizing customer experiences through website landing pages, content creation, and marketing automation platforms like Pardot and Eloqua. I also drew on over a decade of experience with Adobe Creative Suite — Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign — to build high-quality creative assets. As my responsibilities expanded, I found myself managing corporate websites, diving into front-end code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and working with various CMS platforms. This blend of creativity and technical work sparked a lasting passion for web development.`,
      "aboutme3": `
      As I began taking on more coding responsibilities, I realized I wanted to go deeper. To challenge myself and accelerate my learning, I enrolled at LearningFuze — attending intensive night classes while continuing to work full-time. There, I tackled complex programming challenges and gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, jQuery, React, and Node.js. I built several front-end applications in React, and expanded into back-end development with Node.js, Express, and database management. That immersive experience solidified my identity as a developer.`,
      "aboutme4": `
      Today, I bring a rare combination of skills: a background in digital marketing and customer engagement, paired with hands-on experience in web development and programming. I thrive in cross-functional environments and love building solutions that are both technically sound and user-centered. I'd be excited to bring this passion, dedication, and hybrid skill set to your team.`,
