      "aboutme2": `
      I started my career optimizing digital customer experiences through landing pages, content creation, and marketing automation tools like HubSpot, Eloqua, and Pardot. With over a decade of Adobe Creative Suite expertise, I built engaging creative assets while also managing corporate websites and front-end development in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP across platforms like WordPress and SharePoint. This mix of marketing execution, creativity, and technical development gave me a unique ability to bridge creative strategy with web performance. To strengthen my technical depth, I completed advanced training at LearningFuze, where I built React applications and expanded into back-end development with Node.js, Express, and database management. Today, I bring a full-stack perspective to digital marketing, blending campaign strategy, content, analytics, and technology to deliver measurable growth.`,
